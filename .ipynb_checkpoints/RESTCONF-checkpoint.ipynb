    "## Overview\n",
    "Figuring out the URL path and required JSON payload from YANG modules manually can be challenging. There is some guess work that has to happen to select the correct YANG module file with the configuration parameters you are looking for, and then once again if augmentation of the feature being configured is in use. In that case there will actually be two YANG modules that you need to look at, as will be seen in the upcoming sections.  There's a great utility called YANG Suite that is very helpful with figuring out the RESTCONF requests.  See my [blog post](https://blog.networktocode.com/post/using-cisco-yang-suite-to-build-restconf-requests/) for more info on using that. That will likely be no help on the exam, however. For exam study purposes, the below sections work through figuring out the URL path and JSON payload manually by examining the YANG modules in tree format.  \n"

    "To determine the URL path, examine the `ietf-interfaces` YANG module. A utility called `pyang` can be used to view the model in tree format as shown below, using the command `pyang --format tree [module_filename]`.  Module files can be found in the [YANG github repo](https://github.com/YangModels/yang/tree/main/vendor/cisco/xe/1791)\n",
    "\n",
    "The URL path will follow the format: https://{hostname}/restconf/data/{module}:{container}/{resource}.  Looking at the below YANG model, the module is `ietf-interfaces`, the container is `interfaces` and the resource is `interface`.  The `*` next to interface indicates that it is a leaf list, meaning there can be multiple interfaces.  In this case the path would be https://{hostname}/restconf/data/ietf-interfaces:interfaces/{interface}. \n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a new interface, the resource part of the URL is specified in the payload.  To create a new interface, we need to send a payload consisting of the following to https://{hostname}/restconf/data/ietf-interfaces:interfaces.  \n",

    "For static routes, We need to first look at the routing container in the `ietf-routing` module. In order to view the routing table for a particular instance (VRF), we can specify the instance name as the key.  Here we'll use the default VRF. As shown below in the YANG tree, routing-protocol is a key which can be selected by specifying both a type and a name.  Static routes have a type of `static`, and with a name of 1.  Therefore, the path to get the static routes in the default VRF:\n",
