If you did a hard reset, and need to go back it is possible to do so using this command.  If you need to go back but do not know how many commits back before the reset, the `git reflog` command can be used to see a listing of all resets and commits. In the below example,  two commits are made.  After the second commit,  a hard reset is used to return to the first commit.  Then, `git reset HEAD{1} --hard` is used to go back to the second commit (right befor the reset).  \n",
